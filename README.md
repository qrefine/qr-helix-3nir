# qr-helix-3nir
This is a helix extracted from Crystal structure of small protein crambin at 0.48 A resolution. Except for its high resolution property, its sidechain is complete and diverse.

## simulated map are generated by commands:
1. phenix.fmodel helix_3nir_6_19.pdb high_res=4 low_res=6
2. phenix.mtz2map helix_3nir_6_19.pdb.mtz include_fmodel=True
3. mv helix_3nir_6_19.pdb_fmodel.ccp4 map.ccp4
